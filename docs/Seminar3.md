Comparing API Architectural Styles
```

What is the paper about? 
----

This article is about 4 API architecture styles which are RPC, SOAP, REST, GRAPHQL.

It is described each of them in details, the advantages, disadvantages and examples of use.


What is a server / client stub, in the context of RPC? 
----

A stub takes care of serialization and deserialization of parameters.

What does it mean to be integrated with WS-security protocols? Exemplify some of these protocols and what they protect against. 
----
WS-Security conventions give protection and keenness interior exchanges whereas permitting for encryption within the message level. Applying the components for securing web administrations at the message level: confirmation, keenness, and privacy. Confirmation approves the client and decides whether a client is substantial in specific setting. Integrity ensures that data isn't changed, modified, or misplaced incidentally. Privacy employments message encryption to guarantee that no porty or process can get to or uncover the data within the message.


How do you understand HATEOAS? 
----

With HATEOS, responses to REST requests return not only data, but also actions that can be performed on the resources. This helps make applications loosely coupled.

"GraphQL has subscriptions" - What are subscriptions? Why would we need them? 
----

Memberships are GraphQL highlights that permits a server to send information to its clients when a particular occasion happens. Memberships are valuable for informing your client in real-time around changes to back-end information, such as the creation of a modern question or overhauls to an imperative field.


Order the API patterns by message size. 
----

1. `RPC`
2. `GRAPHQL`
3.	`REST`
4.	`SOAP`


Which API pattern would best fit your laboratory work? Why?
----
Appropriate will be the utilize of REST, since it has the most elevated level of reflection and best modeling of the API. It grants to have decoupled client and server, accomplishing adaptability and remaining steady which is incredible for disseminated frameworks.
